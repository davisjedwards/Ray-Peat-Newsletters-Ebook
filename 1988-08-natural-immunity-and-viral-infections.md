# Natural Immunity and Viral Infections
W F. Koch worked in MosesGomberg's lab, where freeradicals were first observed.Koch soon constructed a theory ofnaturaIimmuni ty against vi rus and cancer. basedon his belief in the existence ofbiologicalfree radicals, able tooxidize virus partidesand carcinogenic molecules. Koch believedthat allergies were an early sign of thefailure of this free radical oxidationsystem.l
Albert Szent-GyOrgyi worked out someof Koch's ideas, and in the processdiscovered vitamin C (which has a freeradical state), and explored many otherenergy exchange processes, inc]udi ngfreeradical activation by biological pigments,'
Both of these men argued that there isa special interaction between biologicalstructure and the activated electronicstate, and that both structuml nndelectronic properties of molecules areinvolved in their toxic or therapeuticfunctions.
This model of cell structure andfunction leads to the eXpedation that anysubstance is likely to have a broad rangeof effects, acting on many different celltypes, and promoting or suppressing cellfunctions, depending on the cell's typeand its present state.
In this view, the living material is notan ordinary liquid, but is deeplystructured, somewhat like a liqui dcrystal,and this structure is subject to manyphysical influences, in the process ofadapting to a changing environment. 3
Newer techniques are letting usvisualize more of this finely structuredcellular system, and it has been foundthat many types of virus replicatethemselves while attached to the cellmesh-work.4 Alterations in the mesh-work and the adjoining water willobviously affect the ability of the virus tomultiply.
The highest energy states of the celltend toexclude water soluble substances,and to absorb oil soluble materials. Thecomponents of a virus have very specificaffinities for water and oil, and they canbeassembledonlyina very special90lventenvironment. As mentioned above, asubstance which modifies any type of cellwill modify others. The high energy stateofa cell is an electrically "hyperpolarized"358state,and for a nerve cell thisis an inhibited,quiet state.
## Camphor
There is a long history of anestheticsubstances being used to treat viral diseases.Abrams, in a 1910 textbook, described theuse ofchlorofonn to cure a viral disease in ahorse. Camphor, besides being used as alocal anesthetic and a heart stimulanl, hasbeen used to treat influenza and othersystemic diseases,6 and is one of the oldesttopical treatments for herpes sores. Morerecently, a veterinarian reported curing an~ncurable· virus disease in a dog with ananesthetic dose of ether.
Adamantane, which can be extractedfrom petroleum, is a close structural analogofcarnphor, and smells like camphor. Withthe addition of a nitrogen atom, it is watersoluble, and is an effective anti-viral agenl,There is a long history .of anesthetic substancesbeing used to treatviral diseases.and is also widely used in treatingParkinson's disease (its function ischolinolytic),' and more recently is beingused in preventing withdrawal symptomsin cocaine addiction.' It is not metabolized,and does not present the genetic risk thathas recently been recognized for other anti-viral agents which disrupt viral DNA.''
The fact that the body is well suppliedwith substances which -ata slightly higherconcentration - are anesthetics. and whichare depleted by the stresses which predisposeto viral infections, suggests that they maynonna1ly have a camphor-like anti-viralactivity. Some of these substances, theanesthetic steroids, have been found toprevent some viral infections,l and they alsohave a wide range of anti-toxic efTects. lDPregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, andpregnanediol are all good candidates as anti-viral drugs, bur. etiocholanolone - whichalso produces feverll-is the most interestingof the group.
It is well-known that stress, acti ng mai nlythrough the glucocorticoid honnones,damages immunity by destroying thymuscells. The anesthetic steroids, especiallyprogesterone, nonnally reduce the needfor secretion of cortisol, but also act as aprotective buffer against the damagingeffects of cortisol.
Although a physiologically balancedamount of cortisol induces enzymes ofdetoxification, forexam pIe in the intestine,an unopposed excess causes destructionof these enzymes, elimi nating much oftheintestine's barrier function, and leadingtoallergiea.lI Thisaction ofcortisol againstthe thymus and against the bowel'sdetoxifying enzymes very likely 8«OUntsfor the common association of allergieswith virus infections. Since cortisol has adestabilizing, pro-convulsanteffecton thenervous system, there are likely to bepsychological symptoms - anything fromcompulsive behavior to depression orseizures - associated with the otherchronic conditions.
In the last century, it was observedthat digitoxin (a natural steroid derivative)lowered the fever caused by enteritis.1IThis is probably another example of acatatoxic function, a protective functioncommon to many steroids, and probablyworked by way of stabilizing thedetoxifying enzymes and preventing theabsorption of endotoxin.u Endotoxin isknown to destabilize and inactivate thebowel's detoxifying enzymes, just as anoverdose of cortisol does. 14
## Biological Erasers
Although it is important to be aware of the deadly effects of chronic, unopposed exposure to cortisol (and estrogen and prolactin), these honnones which cause atrophy and loss of function in various tissues also have a creative function. Ihave elsewhere called them the biological-erasers: the hormones of new beginnings. 16 In the case of cortisol, it might be useful to compare its effects on tissue cells to the precess of winnowingwheal, in which the chafTis blown away while the grain is retained. I think there is a mechanism, as proposed by Meerson, in which a functional load preserves the cells and systems which are needed in the present environment, while idle cells aTeeliminated or reduced by cortisol's catabolic action. I ' In this view,intermittent exposure to these hormoneswould improve resistance, but continuinguninterrupted exposure will destroyresistance.
Adequate energy, for example asavailable glucose. is protective againstcortisol·induced catabolism. White bloodcells can protect themselves bymetabolizing cortisol in the presence ofsufficient glucose.l ?
Some of the consequences of stress arenot catabolic. When the detoxifyingenzymes have been lost, then bowel toxinsblock other basic enzyme systems.leadingfor example to slowed protein turnover'and decreased activity of superoxidedismutase.lf The consequent increase oflipid peroxidation will decrease steroidsynthesis.tO Stress also leads to theproduction of intracellular toxins,includi ng ammonia and carbon monoxide,which tend to perpetuate the blocked state.
Justns with the anesthetic lubstanceswhich modify the physical state of thecell. retarding viral replication. theoxidative protective system has severalpoint.sat which intervention is possible tosupport detoxification, and to promoteprotein turnover.
## Injecting Enzymes
Although natural promotion of theenzymes which degrade proteins andnucleic acids will help to shin theequilibrium away from virus production,recent research shows that it can betherapeutic toinject enzymes (nucleases,both DNAase and RNAase) which degradeviral nucleic ncids.u Using labelledenzymes, it has been demonstrated thatvirus and enzyme can enter the cytoplasmin the same vesicle. In herpetic keratitis,the enzyme is used as drops and alsoinjected under the conjunctiva, and ininfectious mononucleosis and viralencephalitis it is injectedintramu!W:ularly.'1 In treating a viralparalysis of bees, the enzyme isadministered as an aerosol. It was foundthat treatment increased the viability andproductivity of outwardly healthy bees,apparently by curing a latent viralinfection. '1
While W.F. Koch wasinterestedin thebody's own oxidative free radical systemof destroying toxins and pathogens, hestudied several natural qui nones found inmedicinal plants. Recent work has foundthat phototoxins extracted from plantscan k.m mouse-cytomegalovirus withoutdamaging the mouse cells.n Theseresearchers selected chemicals which donot disrupt genetic material, recognizingTownsend Letter for Doctors AugfSept. 1988the probability of MriOUS side effects.
Although injected enzymes and planttoxins are safer than some currentchemotherapies, the beak approach tocontrol.ling viral diseases should be tosupport natural immunity, by maintainingenergy production at a high level. byunblocking and stabilizing the detoxifyingenzymes, including mono-oxygenases.proteolytic enzymes, SOD, and nucleases,and by avoiding prolonged catabolic states.Many natural substances are availablewhich promote these ends, without risk.
While this approach supports the knownmechanismofthe immune system, includingprotection of thymus cells and activation ofthe various white cell mechanisms ofattack,it has the novel feature of altering cellsphysically to retard viral assembly.increasing their exposure to nucleases,proteases. and mono-oxygenases; that is. itmobilizes immune processes in cells whichare not part of the immune system. Byeliminatingstreu-inducedsusceptibility, itsystematically shifts the balance towardnormal functioning. and away from parasiticdiversion of the organism's resources.
