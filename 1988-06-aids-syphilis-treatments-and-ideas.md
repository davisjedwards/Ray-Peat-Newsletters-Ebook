# AIDS/Syphilis Treatments & Ideas
Two of the bestartides on AIDS that Ihave read are by Katie Leishman in TMAliantic (August, 1987 and January,1988). In the earlier artide, she discussedsome of the poorly publicized alternativetheories about the cause of the disease,and presented some of the argumentsabout the method of transmission,especially about lice. In the Januaryarticle, she concentrate. on theassociation between AIDS and syphilis.
leiShman quotes the argument of JeanMcKenna, of Berkeley, that the AIDS-associated virus, HIV, is a by.productofthedisease, rather than ita cause, and that itprobably only infects someone who isalready immunosuppressed. Reading theolder scientific Itterature, McKennalearned that both Kaposi'. IIIln:Om8. andpneumocysac carinii pneumonia had beenassociated with syphilia.
The literature suggeated thatsyphilitic patients are prone to variousopportunistic infections, as AIDS patientsare, although syphilia does not appear toIJUpprHs the immune system unal itslatent and tertiary stages. She testedtwenty.four HIV-positive IJUbjects (mostof whom were ARC and AIDS patients)with a documented hiatory of syphilis.Although all of their ITA (fluorescenttreponema! antibody) tests should havebeen reactive, twenty-one were not.McKenna speculated that all AIDSpatients might have syphilis.
In 1981, before AIDS had beenrecognized, two Gennan physicians, K.Oierig and U. Waldthaler, guessed thatgonorrheal endocarditis might be causinga patient's hot flashes, dTRstic weight loss,shortness of breath, and confusion, sothey treated him with 40 million units ofpenicillin intravenously each day forthree weeks. His symptoms disappeared,and later they found he tested positive forHIV, and a review ofhis'19B1 laboratorytests 路showed abnormalities consistentwith AlDS." Dierig and Waldthaler thenused the same penicillin treatment on sixother ARC and AIDS patients. All sevenare now "clinically asymptomatic.路 (Theusual treatment for syphilis in the US is asingle injection of 2.4 million units ofbenzathine penicillin. This form ofpenicillin does not penetrate the brain. Insome countries, syphilis is treated for ayear.)
Leishman also describes the work ofSalvatore Catapano, of Valley Stream,Long Island. Thirty years ago, Catapanolearned that the Enterobacteriaceaestimulate immunity, and found thattyphoid vaccine could stop the growth oftumors. When he saw patients withKaposi's sarcoma, he was reminded ofsyphilitic sores he had seen in the tropics.Catapano believes that the tropicalspirochetal disease, yaws, shouldn't beconsidered 88 a distinct disease. Headvocates the use of typhoid vaccine tostimulate the immune system beforetreating AIDS patients with penicillin.Catapano also believes that "syphilis"infections can occur without the presenceof a spirochete, possibly by a virug..likevariant of the organism. This idea hasbeen proposed many times, e.g., byBergel, in Syphilis im Lichte neuerUntenuchungen, Jena, 1925.
A few months ago, D.J. Bauer ofWellcome Laboratories, wrote an articleon the history of antiviral drugs. I know ofhis 1959 work, in which he showed thatcopper inhibited the growth of a lipid-coated virus in the brains of mice, so I wassurprised to see that he didn't mentioncopper or zinc, and that his story beganwith the introduction of amantadine in1964 to treat influenza (which,like herpesand HIV, is also lipid-coated). I had beeninterested in amantadine for a long time,because it modifies nerve function in a way(anti-cholinergic) that I think mimicscertain steroid hormones which I considerto be part of our natural anti路viral defensesystem. So I was also surprised to see thatBauer gave no explanation of the origin ofamantadine.
Amantadine (or adamantaneamine) is awater soluble form (l-amino-adamatane) ofa substance that occurs in petroleum. Inoticed that adamantane smells likecamphor, and that it has a cage-like shapewhich is very much like that of camphor.Camphor has a long history of use as a germ-killer (e.g., Campho-phenique, for herpes),and was used successfully in the greatinfluenza epidemic 70 years ago. I assumethat the idea of using amantlldine to treatinfluenza was based on its obvioussimilarity to natural camphor. An oxidizedform of camphor, camphoric acid, also has afaint odor of camphor, and has been used asan oral germ-lOBer. It was tested as asyphilis treatment in comparison withpenicillin and the traditional arseniccompound, salvarsan, shortly afterpenicillin baeame commercially available.All three eliminated the syphilis infection,but the drug companies were already set upto produce large amounts of penicillinprofitably. Camphoric acid was used tocarry bismuth, another heavy metal thatwas effective against the syphilis organism.(I was interested in using camphoric acid totransport copper, making it able to enter thebrain and also causing it to be absorbed viathe lymphatic system, by-passing the liverand thus allowing a large dose to beabsorbed without injuring the liver. Iswallowed a small amount, and the nextmorning, noticing that my mouth felt freshwhen I woke up, found that my tongue didn'thave its customary coating. I have heardthat hannlesa spirochetes tend to grow onthe tongue).
Infection with the "trench mouth"organism, Ttepenema Vincenti, was oftenassociated with a deficiency of white bloodcells. Another spirochetal disease, Weil'sdisease, involved fever, headache,vomiting, and intestinal bleeding. Stillanother type of spirochetal infection wasknown in Mexico as "pinta," and mainlyinvolved depigmentation of the skin. Earlyin the century, some of the abnormalities ofpigmentation, teeth and hair development,and defects in blood vessels, that had beenattributed to syphilis were found to resultfrom a copper deficiency.
For at least 80 years, people have beerobserving an association betweeranesthesia and the elimination of virainfections. We have at least three naturaanesthetic systems, namely, the GAB;system, the endorphins, and the steroid,(especially progesterone). These veT)likely are just three aspects of a singllsystem. Close analogs of the GABAsystem are already known to have antiviral action.
About 60 years ago, it was commonl)believed that women, especially durinfpregnancy, aTe resistant to syphilisMoore (Johns Hopkins Hasp. BuLL 34, p89, 1923) states that it is fair to assumtthat pregnancy is the factor whicrsuppresses the lesions of the disease. TIllprotection may persist over a long perio(of yeaTs and possibly for a lifetimeSpontaneous cure seems in a fe\\instances to have been the ultimatEresult.
It seems necessary to believe that somfosubstance produced in the course 01pregnancy and non-existent in the tissue~and body fluids of males and non-pregnant women is antagonistic to thespirochaetae, but whether this is derivecfrom corpus luteum, or other organ ofinternal secretion, or from the placenta orfoetus, is merely a subject for speculation.(W.G. MacCallum, A T.ext-Book 0;PatMLogy, W.B. Saunders, 1937, p. 684:
Camphor, progesterone, nutritionalsupplements, and artificial fever haveeven fewer side-effects than penicillin,and should be tested more widely. TheGABA analogs, besides being non-toxic,have the additional advantage of beingvery cheap. In the pharmaceutical.bureaucratic world, though, this has toooften been a fatal defect.
The close association betweenimmunity and the balance of iron andcopper suggests that the iron/copperratioshould be studied in AIDS.2 The fact thathemosiderosis (a disease of excess ironabsorption)occurs mainly in Africans andin transfusion recipients might beexpected to relate to the virulence of anyinfectious disease in those populations.The tumor of Kaposi's sarcoma is oftenpigmented with hemosiderin. Althoughthe suppressive effect of iron on theimmune system is well-known, it isgenerally ignored, probably because ofour society's obsessive belief that "'iron isgood for you." Iron's effect on the immunesystem is interestingly examined by JuneGoodfield in An Imagined World.
Since I mentioned the endorphinsabove in the context of resistance toinfections, I should mention that theseendogenous peptides are really a family ofsubstances with very different properties;some activate the right side or the brain,others activate the left. side.3 The twosides orthe brain have different etreets onthe immune system. Opiates BTe powerfulsuppressors of immunity.S I think it isclear that morphine and codeine shouldnever be used when there is an immunedeficiency.
