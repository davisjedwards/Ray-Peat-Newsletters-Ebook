# Ray Peat Newsletters Ebook
The goal of this project is to increase access to Dr. Raymond Peat's writings by creating a well-formatted, readable compilation of his newsletters into a single eBook with all the references intact.

Compile the directory into an epub using markdown:
```
pandoc -o ebook.epub -f markdown -t epub *.md 
```
