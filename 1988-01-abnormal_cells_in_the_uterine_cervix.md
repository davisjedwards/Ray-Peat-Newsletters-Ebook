# Abnormal Cells in the Uterine Cervix
T he membranes of the mouthand of the uterine cervix arevery similar, and both aresusceptible to development of asupposedly precancerous condition,called leukoplakia. Every wintersince I moved to Oregon, I developedareas on the inside of my cheekswhere they met my teeth, thatbecame spongy and white, andtended to be imprinted with theshape of my teeth, bulging in a waythat caused me to bite my cheekfrequently. When I learned thatvitamin A would control my dandruffand acne, I then noticed that it alsonormalized my mouth membranes. Adentist noticed my spongy white spotsone winter when I hadn't been takingvitamin A, and gravely warned me thatit was a precancerous condition,leukoplakia (sometimes calledpsoriasis buccalis, or dyskeratosis),and that I should have it checked by adoctor frequently. I went home and tookvitamin A, and it was gone within a fewdays. This experience increased myinterest in leukoplakia and led me toread more about it. Because of thesimilarity of cell type in the cervix andin the mouth, I suggested to a friendthat she try vitamin A when her doctortold her that she had cervicalleukoplakia, and it cleared up rightaway.
Since the beginning ofthe century,it has been known that estrogen iscarcinogenic, and by the 19405 it wasclear that the hormone of the corpusluteum, progesterone, opposesestrogen's effects, and that itconsistently prevented estrogen-induced cancers, and sometimescured them. In the 1950s, it waslearned that vitamin A and estrogenhave opposite effects, for example,when applied locally to the skin.! Itwas found that. to a very great extent,progesterone could substitute forvitamin A, meaning that a very largefraction of the vitamin A used by thebody is used up in makingprogesterone, from which the othersteroid hormones are made.
Considering these facts, it seemedapparent that optimal treatment ofleukoplakia would involve a programto lower the chronic background levelof estrogen, while promotingprogesterone synthesis. It happensthat the body spontaneously moves inthat direction, if given the rightsupport. With adequate protein(eggs, milk, cheese, shellfish, liver,etc.), the liver removes estrogen fromthe blood entirely on its first passagethrough the liver, in an otherwisehealthy organism. Inhypothyroidism, the livermetabolism slows, allowing estrogento accumulate; also, hypothyroidismappears to allow ovarian cysts todevelop and to secrete additionalestrogen. While the thyroid hormonepromotes the elimination ofestrogen,it happens to be essential for theproduction of progesterone. VitaminA (with cholesterol) is consumed at ahigh rate by the corpus luteum, whenthere is adequate thyroid hormone.However, carotene also tends to beaccumulated by the corpora lutea,because of its chemical similarity tovitamin A-it is probably a mixture ofvitamin A and carotene iliatgives thecorpus luleum its yellow color -butcarotene seems to compete withvitamin A for the active syntheticsites, with the result that too muchcarotene is toxic to the corpus lut.eum,and is a fairly common cause offailureto have menstrual cycles. Bothvitamin A and carotene, like anyunsaturated oil, will tend to inhibitthe thyroid, so it is important tobalance supplements of vitamin A andthyroid; a sluggish thyroid will moreeasily be suppressed by large doses ofvitamin A. but a high level of thyroidactivity causes vitamin A to be usedmore quickly. It is an interestingexpression of this biologicalrelationship that one blood proteincarries both vitamin A and thyroidhormone.
To back up this basic process ofhormone balancing, there are a fewthings that can be done besidesproviding animal protein, vitamin Aand thryoid. Vitamin E causesvitamin A to be used more efficiently,and besides taking about 100 unitsorally, a mixture of vitamin E,vitamin A. and progesterone can beapplied directly to the cervicalmembrane. In rapid cell division, andin estrogen excess, folic acid and otherB vitamins are used rapidly, so asupplement might be useful. I haveusually suggested a dose of one to tenmilligrams offoHc acid daily for a fewweeks, with liver two or three times aweek for the other vitamins.Magnesium is not retained wellduring stress or in hypothyroidism, soa supplement of several hundredmilligrams daily is desirable; epsomsalts in orange juice is wellassimilated and magnesium oxideshould not be used because it is notabsorbed. Plenty of bright light helpsto maintain progesterone synthesis.Vitamin C and zinc are needed, butwill probably be provided by the meat,liver, oysters and orange juice whichwill provide many of the calories;beans, seeds, sprouts, and seed oils,and raw broccoli or cabbage should beavoided, because they can disrupt thehormone balance.
I personally had contact with 35women who were advised to have ahysterectomy because of abnormalcells found in Pap smears or biopsies,but who wanted to try this approach fora month or two. All of those women hadnonnal tests when they went back tothe doctor, usually in two months.Later, I heard that groups had beenfanned to teach the method, but Ihaven't heard whether the resultscontinue to be 100%.
