# Inhibition and Vitality
In the Achillesreflex test, slow relaxation of the calf muscleis used to demonstrate the low metabolism ofhypothyroidism. In the high energy penon.relaxation is instantaneous, This is a genernlprinciple for the brain and other tissues: thehigh energy state is relaxed. Epilepsy is anexample of a very low energy state of braincells. Insomnia is a low energy state, and isusually cured by the right dose of thyroidhormone. with adequate glucose and othernutrienlS. Insomnia is extremely common inaging people. and is the main problem atmenopause. Inflammation is another exampleof a low energy state. Specific paltems ofs)'mptoms can be produced by reflexes. andthese reflexes can be stuck in place by anenergy deficiency. Focussed activity and analert readiness to respond are prevented by alow energy SUIte, which can cause us to getstuck in inappropriate activity, ranging fromworry to ''auto-immune'' condjtions. Theinhibited stale of nerves has not been a popularfield for research in our culture, but theknowledge gradually accumulates. Anothertype of inhibition has been described recently,in "Acetylcholine hyperpolarizes centralneurones by acting on an M, muscarinicreceptor," by Egan and North, in Nature 319,405-407, January 30, 1986.
## Burton
Last year the Center for DiseaseControl tested some of Dr. Burton's immuno-augmentative therapeutic material. and foundthaI 50% of it was conUlminated with AIDSvirus (at least the antibodies), and that all ofit tested positive for hepatitis. Since he hadbeen getting aU of his blood from the U.S., fromcommercial sources, this sounded suspicious.In the 1960s he was highly respected, The yearhe got in trouble, 1975, was the year the cancerestablishment decided to follow his leads inimmunotherapy. Dr. Coley's toxins wereremoved from the "quack remed}'" list. Lastyear, when Burton's institution was closeddown because of the incredibly high rate ofAIDS contamination. was the year that thebiggest institutional researcher.; began theirpromotion of the tumor necrosis factor-whichBurton discovered. Burton used a variety ofblood derived materials. but purification willbe necessary before a drug company cancontrol it satisfactorily. [f the stuff doesn't killpeople, along with the cancer, it also has greatfinancial potential as a weight· loss drug. I havebeen trying to learn his side of thecontamination story, so! recently tried callinghis 800 number. but ! was too late, and thewoman who answered said she had noknowledge of his org:anization, shejust workedfor the U.S. Army. If you know his address.please let me know.
## Black Body Radiation
A red hot objectradiates lower enel1O', longer Wa\'es than a veryhot star does, and a warm person radiatesslightly longer, lower energy waves than doesthe red hot object. The peak of our radiantemission is long infra'red, and we are fairlytrans"arent to that wave-length, so we areblack body emitters. regardless of our skincolor [t has been calculated that 70% of ourmetabolic energy is spent as radiation. J( weare surrounded by large amounts of mass at ourown temperature, we will absorb about asmuch as we lose. Several years ago, lab ratswere kept at a constant temperature, withconstant 12 hour light periods. were found toexperience a decline in thyroid function duringthe winter. I had noticed a similar effect infrom Ray Peat's Newsletter(Feb, 1986)hamsters. atrophy of the thymus gland in thelate autumn. Since long'wave infra-red andlonger wavelength microwaves can penetratewalls to some extent, it could be that theabsence of that kind of radiation during thewinter is the stressor which causes thesechanges. and the mitochondrial damage whichoccurs in the winter. It could be that some ofthe therapeutic effects of natural hot springsare caused by gently appropriate radiationfrom the large masses of hot earth In thevicinity.! think these longer waves might alsohave an anti-free radical effect, possibly byacting on solvated electrons.
## Forests
In the early 1950.'1 I went back toa stream! had seen a couple of years earlier,in southern Oregon; it was one of the mostbeautiful places I had seen. On my second visit,it had been absolutely destroyed by loggers.who had bulldozed earth, broken logs, androcks into it. It wasjust one of the many smallstreams where fish used to spawn, that havenow been destroyed by loggers. A forester hassaid that much of southern Oregon wiU neverbe able to grow forests again, because the soilwas eroded after the trees were cut.
A recent news item mentioned that theAtacama desert in Chile also used to be ahumid coastal forest, and that it was destroyedby loggers. Another news item mentioned thatremoval of trees from the Mexican hill wherethe Monarch butterflies migrate for the winter.was lowering the humidity to such an extentthat the bulterflies. might not be able tosurvive, even though their own trees are notremoved. This effect of trees on humidity is\'ery important, but it is usually overlooked.The concept of "desertification is widelyaccepted when it is applied to anothercontinent (the Sudan, for example), but notwhen it might reiate to a local resource whichsupports the area's biggest industry. 
When 1 first went to Mexico in 1955, I wasshocked by the huge gullies that were beingeroded through the dark brown soil of the hillygrass-covered expanses in the western part orthe State of Mexico. [n later year.; those sharpcuts through the muddy earth haddisappeared, and a smooth contour hadreturned, but the remaining soil was pale androcky, and barely supported grass. A few yearsago I learned that this region had been coveredby the same dense pine forests which still existin some parts of the SUIte, but that a foreigncompany had removed the forests early in thiscentury. A place there is still called EI Yukon.
Now that most of the forests, from theCalifornia redwoods inw Washington, havebeen destroyed, the center of the loggingindustry has moved north into Canada.Foresters describe the logging technique usedthere as "extraction:' and say it won't be longuntil their forests are depleted, so that maybeOregon's forests will regain their competitiveposition. Canada's Yukon might somedayresemble El Yukon in Mexico, When a regiondoesn't go directly from a conifer forest to adesert, it may be replaced by deciduous shrubsand trees. The ultimate outcome of thisreplacement is unknown, but I think we arealready seeing some of the effects. Conifers aregood at conserving water: they transpiresparingly in the hot, normally dry summers of230the Pacific coast region, but they do transpirea little in the winter. Humid air is lighter thandry air: a massive forest allows ocean air tocirculate over the land in wintet; yet a coniferforest does not extravagantly increase thehumidity in the summer. A deciduous forest,leafless in winter. allows dense cold dry air toaccumulate, which di\'erts the humid ocean air.In the summer, however, their intensetranspiration tends to intensify the entry of airfrom the ocean, with the result that rainfalltends to become seasonally reversed, and someof the winter moisture is dumped further!Iouth. People who defend the lumberindustry's practices say that the forcescontrolling weather are too big to beinfluenced by human activity, but severalstudies show otherwise. For example, theabsence of vegetation in the city of St. Louis causes such intense summer heating andupdrafts that com production has doubled inan area down-wi(ld. from the resulting increasein the summer fainfall.
Caffeine, A study in Israel, where there hasbeen no publicity about a connection betweencaffeine and breast disease, found that usingcaffeine or avoiding it had no effect on breastdisease, A letter in JAMA (Feb. 14, 1986, vol.255(6), page 748) says "most reports show nosignificant correlation between fibro·cysticdisease and methylxanthine intake." He says"there was considerable evidence to suggestthat caffeine has antineoplastic effects." Healso says that "caffeine inUlke had a significantassociation with tumor differentiation. , .Since poor tumor differentiation is linked withdecreased survival, the question is raisedwhether caffeine may have had a beneficialeffect in these women." All of the experimentsin cell culture similarly suggest lhal caffeinemight be beneficial.
## Cystic Fibrosis
Several years ago a "mutation" was discovered in a regionalprimate center which was said to be equivalentto human cystic fibrosis. A researcher therecouldn't believe that an identical mutationcould have appeared at the same time in fiveor six apes: he believed that their symptomsresulted from poisoning from the largeamounts of unsaturated vegetable oil theywere being fed. He was fired immediatel)': thenew "gene" would have brought in largeamounts of research money, A recent study ofyoung adults with cystic fibrosis found thatthey had low serum le\'els of both selenium andvitamin E, This seems to support the ex'scientist's theory. (La"cet 2:862-863, 1985,)
## Food Radiation
As sulfite is remo\'ed fromfoods. pressure will increase for wider use ofradiatlon to extend shelf life of many foods.Proponents are saying that some publiceducation will be necessary, because radiationcauses instantaneous changes which modifynavor and texture of foods, making peoplethink they are not fresh: people must beinrormed, they say, to realize that the spoiledtaste and consistency actually means greaterfreshness, since their shelf life has beenextended by many weeks. Radiation, of course,stimulates oxidation of fals. among otherchanges (called "unique radiolytic products."URP), and rancid fat is toxic andcarcinogenic.
